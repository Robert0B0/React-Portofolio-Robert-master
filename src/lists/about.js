		"Eager to build useful and easy to use software tools and websites. I started with the premise that in order to prepare I need to learn from someone that is more knowledgeable, works and has experience in the field. That came after, like many others in similar situations, “spin in circles“ in the sea of information online and blindly copy-paste code, without an understanding foundation. And so I searched and found the right places and people to learn, improve, fail, try again and grow until I can have the skills and capabilities to build whatever I envision and/or is needed.",
